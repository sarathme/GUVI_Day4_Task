### Question 1a (Print odd numbers in an array).

```
1 - Created a function called printOdd which accepts an array of numbers(arr).

2 - Loop through the array using for loop.

3 - Check each element in the array is not divisible by 2 if so log that number
in console.
```

### Question 1b (Convert all the strings to title caps in a string array).

```
1 - Created a function called titleCaps which accepts an string array(arr).

2 - Loop through the array(arr).

3 - Split each element using a space pattern(strArr).

4 - Check the if the length of the strArr is greater than 1 (i.e) the string has
two or more words.

4a - If step -4 is true, then loop through the strArr as it contains more than 1 word,

4b - Get the first letter (firstLet) using String substring method and covert to uppercase (toUpperCase method).

4c - Then concatinate the capitalized first letter with the remaining characters in the word.

4d - Repeat the same for each word in the strArr.

4e - Replace the converted string in the position.


5 - If Step 4 in false, then the string is a single word element, if so do the steps 4a, 4b and 4c.

6 - Replace the string in arr with its corresponding position.

```

### Question 1c (Sum of all numbers in an array).

```
1 - Created a function and assigned to a variable called sumArr accepting an array (arr) as a parameter.

2 - Initialize a variable sum as 0.

3 - Loop through the array and add each number in the array to the sum variable.

4 - Return the sum.


```

### Question 1d (Return all the prime numbers in an array).

```
1 - Created a function and assigned to the variable filterPrime accepting an array (arr) as a parameter.

2 - Initialized an variable res with an empty array.

3 - Loop through the array (arr), Initialize a variable isPrime with true.

4 -
```
